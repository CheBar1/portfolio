        <p>
        My career began as a professional musician, with a love of numbers and patterns, who later found a new passion in web development.</p>
        <p>
        I'm a compassionate, fun and friendly person who is honest and punctual. I work well in a team but also on my own, as I like to set myself goals which I will achieve.
        I have excellent communication, attention to detail and problem-solving skills. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
        I have a creative mind and am always up for new challenges.
